The paths module
================

    >>> from pysyte.types import paths
    >>> assert 'extended path classes' in paths.__doc__

We'll need the os module for some of the tests below

    >>> import os
    >>> import sys

Shortcuts
---------
    >>> path = paths.path

Some known paths
----------------

Root of the filesystem
    >>> assert paths.root().isroot()

The tmp directory
    >>> assert paths.tmp() == '/tmp'

The pwd() method is a synonym for os.getcwd()

    >>> start_here = paths.pwd()
    >>> assert start_here == os.getcwd()

cd()
----

The cd() method (at least) calls os.chdir()
It returns True if the change of directory is successful

    >>> assert not paths.cd('/no/such/path')
    >>> assert paths.pwd() == start_here
    >>> assert paths.cd('/usr/lib')
    >>> assert paths.pwd() == '/usr/lib'

cd() recognises the special value '-' to go back to the previous directory

    >>> assert paths.cd('-')
    >>> assert paths.pwd() == start_here

If a cd() fails the value used gets ignored for going back
    >>> paths.cd('/no/such/path') and paths.pwd() or 'fail'
    'fail'
    >>> paths.cd('-') and paths.pwd() or 'fail'
    <DirectPath '/usr/lib'>

Calling using '-' repeatedly will toggle between two directories:

    >>> assert paths.cd('/usr')
    >>> assert paths.cd('/opt')
    >>> for i in range(0,4):
    ...    _ = paths.cd('-')
    ...    print(paths.pwd())
    /usr
    /opt
    /usr
    /opt

If the path to a file is given, cd() will change to that file's parent directory
    /bin/cp is present on nearly all systems
        (but it might be a link to /usr/bin/cp)
    >>> assert paths.cd('/bin/cp')
    >>> assert paths.pwd() in ('/bin', '/usr/bin')

DirectPath
----------

A class called DirectPath is also supplied, which extends the path class, slightly.
You can construct an instance of DirectPath directly:

    >>> p = paths.DirectPath('.')

Or by using the method makepath

    >>> p = paths.makepath('.')

The difference is that makepath expands the string given
    >>> os_home = os.path.expanduser('~')
    >>> assert paths.DirectPath('~') != os_home
    >>> assert paths.makepath('~') == os_home
    >>> if 'HOME' in os.environ:
    ...     assert paths.DirectPath('$HOME') != os_home
    ...     assert paths.makepath('$HOME') == os_home

DirectPath is ako string, which shows the string in %s and %r

    >>> bin_ = paths.DirectPath('/bin')
    >>> print('%s' % bin_)
    /bin
    >>> print('%r' % bin_)
    <DirectPath '/bin'>

makepath() handles many types of things
nothings:
    >>> assert not paths.makepath(None)
    >>> assert not paths.makepath('')

other paths:
    >>> assert paths.makepath(p) is p

strings, and things than can change to strings, e.g. an int
    >>> assert paths.makepath('/some/words/here').name == 'here'
    >>> assert paths.makepath('.').isdir()
    >>> assert paths.makepath(37).name == '37'

including python things, like modules, classes, functions
    >>> path_to_paths = paths.makepath(paths)
    >>> assert path_to_paths.name in ('paths.py', 'paths.pyc')
    >>> assert path_to_paths == paths.makepath(paths.DotPath)
    >>> assert path_to_paths == paths.makepath(paths.makepath)

and other things that have paths
    >>> class Fred:
    ...     path = paths.makepath('/usr/local')
    >>> fred = Fred()
    >>> assert paths.makepath(fred) is fred.path

A specialised version for strings
    >>> assert not paths.makestr('')
    >>> assert paths.makestr(paths.__file__).isfile()
    >>> assert not paths.makestr('/path/to/nowehere').isfile()

Path expansion at creation
--------------------------

    >>> os_home = os.path.expanduser('~')

The makepath method expands paths "normally"
    So both of these end up with the same (string) value:
    >>> direct_home = paths.DirectPath(os_home)
    >>> path_to_home = paths.makepath('~')
    >>> assert direct_home == path_to_home

And that is an expanded path
    >>> assert path_to_home.startswith('/') and '~' not in path_to_home

Using DirectPath (not makepath()), does not expand paths
    so this has a different string value
    >>> squiggle = paths.DirectPath('~')

The unexpanded version is not equal to the expanded
    >>> assert squiggle != path_to_home

But it is the same path
    >>> assert squiggle.same_path(path_to_home)


Method to give a path with a trailing "slash" on directories
    >>> assert path_to_home.slashpath().endswith('/')
    >>> assert not path_to_home.endswith('/')

cd
--

DirectPath adds the cd() method, which cd's to the path it represents
It calls the module level cd() method with its own value, so it works as above.

Newer Linuxen link /bin to /usr/bin
    So for next tests, we will check both
    >>> expected = ('/bin', '/usr/bin')

Can cd to a direcory
    >>> os.chdir('/')
    >>> f = paths.DirectPath('/bin')
    >>> assert f.cd()
    >>> assert paths.pwd() in expected

Can also cd to (the directory of) a file
    >>> os.chdir('/')
    >>> p = paths.makepath('/bin/cp')
    >>> assert p.cd()
    >>> assert paths.pwd() in expected

DirectPath vs path
------------------

Using the / operator on a path gives an instance of the same class
    >>> from path import path
    >>> home = path('~')
    >>> bashrc = home / '.bashrc'
    >>> assert isinstance(bashrc, path)

Using it on a DirectPath can give a DirectPath, or a FilePath
    >>> home = paths.home()
    >>> bashrc = home / '.bashrc'
    >>> expected = paths.FilePath if bashrc.isfile() else paths.NonePath
    >>> assert isinstance(bashrc, expected)

Attributes of may also be DirectPaths or FilePaths
    >>> parent = bashrc.parent
    >>> expected = paths.DirectPath if bashrc.isfile() else paths.NonePath
    >>> assert isinstance(parent, expected)


Various checks on paths
-----------------------

Whether paths exist, are files, are dirs, are hidden, ...

    >>> path_to_paths = paths.path(paths.__file__)
    >>> assert path_to_paths.isfile()
    >>> assert path_to_paths.parent.isdir()
    >>> assert not path_to_paths.isroot()
    >>> assert bashrc.ishidden()
    >>> assert paths.path(sys.executable).isexec()
    >>> assert not paths.path(sys.executable).parent.isexec()

Whether sub_paths exist
-----------------------

This test assumes you have a ~/bin directory
    Also assumes you have a ~/.bashrc file, which is more likely
    >>> sub_paths = [ '.bashrc', 'bin', 'not a real path' ]
    >>> real_paths = paths.home().existing_sub_paths(sub_paths)
    >>> assert paths.home() / '.bashrc' in real_paths
    >>> assert paths.home() / 'bin' in real_paths
    >>> assert paths.home() / 'not a real path' not in real_paths

Iteration of paths
------------------

Iterating a directory gives directory entries (sub-directories and files)

Iterating a file gives lines
    >>> path_to_types = path_to_paths.parent
    >>> path_to_this_test = path_to_types / 'test/paths.test'
    >>> iteratings = [l for l in path_to_this_test if 'Iterating' in l]
    >>> assert 'Iterating a file gives lines' in iteratings

Sets of paths
-------------

    >>> assert '/usr/lib' in paths.list_sub_directories('/usr','l*')
    >>> assert '/usr/lib' not in paths.list_sub_directories('/usr','a*')
    >>> assert '/bin/ls' in paths.set_files('/bin','l*')
    >>> assert '/bin/ls' not in paths.set_files('/bin','a*')

Search directories
----------------

    >>> assert paths.contains_glob('/usr','*oca*')
    >>> assert paths.contains_directory('/usr','*oca*')
    >>> assert not paths.contains_file('/usr','*oca*')

    >>> assert not paths.contains_glob('/usr','*oca')
    >>> assert not paths.contains_file('/usr','*oca')
    >>> assert not paths.contains_directory('/usr','*oca')

Tab completion
--------------

    >>> assert paths.add_star('fred') == 'fred*'
    >>> assert paths.add_star('fred.') == 'fred.*'
    >>> assert paths.add_star('fred.p') == 'fred.p*'

    >>> assert paths.add_stars(['fred', 'fred.', 'fred.py']) == ['fred*', 'fred.*', 'fred.py*']

Try tab completion on some pysyte modules
    >>> incomplete_text = str(path_to_types / 'li')
    >>> completions = paths.tab_complete(incomplete_text)

We expect modules called "lines" and "lists" in same dir as "paths"
    And a package called "literals"
    >>> assert path_to_types / 'lines.py' in completions
    >>> assert path_to_types / 'lists.py' in completions
    >>> assert path_to_types / 'literals' in completions

Parts and parents
-----------------

    >>> assert paths.home()
    >>> assert paths.pwd()

Get the parent directory

    >>> assert paths.path('/one/two/three').parent == '/one/two'

    >>> local_bin = paths.path('/usr/local/bin')
    >>> assert local_bin.parent == '/usr/local'

There is also a more fully spelled-out function to get the parent
    >>> assert local_bin.parent == local_bin.parent_directory()

.parent and .parent_directory() are same for all paths except filesystem root
    For the root it's "parent" is itself
    But it does not have a "parent_directpry"
    >>> root = paths.path('/')
    >>> assert root.parent == root
    >>> assert root.parent_directory() is None

Use the plural to get all parents up to the root (in "ascending" order)
    >>> parents = local_bin.parent_directories()
    >>> assert parents[0] == '/usr/local'
    >>> assert parents[1] == '/usr'
    >>> assert parents[-1].isroot()

Splitting off extensions
------------------------

    >>> path_to_paths = paths.path(paths.__file__)
    >>> assert path_to_paths.ext in {'.py', '.pyc'}
    >>> stem, ext = path_to_paths.splitext()
    >>> assert ext[0] == '.'
    >>> assert f'{stem}{ext}' == paths.__file__

Splitting out parts
-------------------

    >>> parts = local_bin.split()
    >>> assert parts[0].isroot()
    >>> assert parts[1:] == ['usr', 'local', 'bin']

The splitexts method
---------------------

    >>> p = paths.FilePath('/alan/was/here.tar.gz')
    >>> p.splitext()
    (<FilePath '/alan/was/here.tar'>, '.gz')
    >>> p.splitexts()
    (<FilePath '/alan/was/here'>, '.tar.gz')
