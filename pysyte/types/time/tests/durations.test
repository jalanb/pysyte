pysyte.types.time.durations
===========================

    >>> pysyte.types.time import durations
    >>> assert 'durations for pysyte' in durations.__doc__


Duration
--------

    >>> pysyte.types.time.durations import Duration
    >>> one = Duration(0, 0, 1, 15)
    >>> assert one.minutes == 1 and one.seconds == 15
    >>> two = Duration(0, 0, 2, 45)
    >>> assert two.minutes == 2 and two.seconds == 45


Durations can be added

    >>> sum_ = one + two
    >>> assert sum_.minutes == 4 and sum_.seconds == 0

    >>> assert sum_.days + sum_.hours == 0

And subtracted
    >>> assert one == sum_ - two
