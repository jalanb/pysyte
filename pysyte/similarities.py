"""Some popular similarity measures in python

https://dataaspirant.com/2015/04/11/five-most-popular-similarity-measures-implementation-in-python/

Similarity:

The similarity measure is the measure of how much alike two data objects are.
    Similarity measure in a data mining context is a distance with dimensions
    representing features of the objects. If this distance is small, it will be
    the high degree of similarity where large distance will be the low degree
    of similarity.

The similarity is subjective and is highly dependent on domain and application.
    For example, two fruits are similar because of color or size or taste.
    Care should be taken when calculating distance across dimensions/features
    that are unrelated. The relative values of each element must be normalized,
    or one feature could end up dominating the distance calculation. Similarity
    are measured in the range 0 to 1 [0,1].

    In the equation,
        d^MKD is the Minkowski distance between the data record i and j,
        k the index of a variable, n the total number of variables y and
        λ the order of the Minkowski metric.

    Although it is defined for any λ > 0, it is rarely used except 1, 2 and ∞.

    The way distances are measured by the Minkowski metric of different orders
        between two objects with three variables ( In the image it displayed
        in a coordinate system with x, y ,z-axes).

    Synonyms of Minkowski:

    λ = 1 is the Manhattan distance.
    λ = 2 is the Euclidean distance.
        Synonyms are L2-Norm or Ruler distance.
        For two vectors of ranked ordinal variables
            the Euclidean distance is sometimes called Spear-man distance.
    λ = ∞ is the Chebyshev distance.
        Synonyms are Lmax-Norm or Chessboard distance.
