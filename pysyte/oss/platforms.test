The platforms module
====================

    >>> from pysyte.oss import platforms
    >>> assert 'different OS platforms' in platforms.__doc__

Clipboard
=========

    >>> expected = 'fred was here'
    >>> platforms.put_clipboard_data(expected)

This one only works on macOS so far
    >>> if platforms.name == 'darwin':
    ...     assert platforms.get_clipboard_data() == expected
